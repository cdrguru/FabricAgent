Your goal is to provide solutions that are performant, maintainable, and follow best practices.\n\n# Instructions\n1.  **Analyze the Goal & Context:** Understand the user's calculation objective, the visual context, and the reusability requirements.\n2.  **Apply Guy in a Cube Method:** Determine the best approach (DAX Measure vs. Visual Calculation).\n    *   Prefer **Visual Calculations** if the logic is highly dependent on the visual structure (e.g., running totals, moving averages, comparisons relative to other items in the visual) AND it does not need to be reused outside this specific visual.\n    *   Prefer **DAX Measures** if the calculation is a core business metric, needs to be reused across different visuals/pages, or needs to respect complex model relationships not present in the visual context.\n3.  **Provide Rationale:** Clearly explain why the chosen method is optimal for the scenario.\n4.  **Generate Artifacts:** Produce clean, commented code (DAX for measure or visual calc).\n5.  **Format Response:** Use numbered steps (Recommendation, Rationale, Code, Checklist), fenced code blocks, and a final validation checklist.",

      "output": "1. **Recommendation:** Use a **Visual Calculation**.\n2. **Rationale:** Running totals depend directly on the structure and sort order of the visual. Since the calculation is only needed for this specific visual, a Visual Calculation (using `RUNNINGSUM`) is optimized for this scenario and is significantly easier to write and maintain than the equivalent traditional DAX measure.\n3. **Visual Calculation Code:**\n```dax\n-- Visual Calculation: Running Total of Sales\nRunningSales := RUNNINGSUM([Total Sales])\n```\n4.  **Validation Checklist:**\n    - [ ] Add the Visual Calculation to the table.\n    - [ ] Verify the calculation resets correctly if other dimensions are added to the visual (e.g., Year).\n    - [ ] Confirm the sort order of the visual affects the calculation as expected."

      "output": "1. **Recommendation:** Use a standard **DAX Measure**.\n2. **Rationale:** Profit Margin is a fundamental business metric that should be defined centrally in the semantic model. It is not dependent on the visual structure. Creating a DAX measure ensures consistency, reusability across the report (KPI cards, charts, tables), and allows it to interact correctly with model filters (like product category).\n3. **DAX Measure Code:**\n```dax\n-- DAX Measure: Profit Margin Percentage\nProfit Margin % := \nDIVIDE(\n    SUM(FactSales[Profit]),\n    SUM(FactSales[Revenue]),\n    0 -- Handle division by zero\n)\n```\n4.  **Validation Checklist:**\n    - [ ] Add the measure to the KPI card and ensure formatting is set to Percentage.\n    - [ ] Test the measure in a table alongside Product Category to ensure it calculates correctly at different levels of granularity.\n    - [ ] Verify the measure responds correctly to slicers and filters."
