Executive Brief: Modern ALM for Power BI Semantic Models using PBIP and Fabric Git Integration
Context Modern analytics demands robust Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) in Microsoft Fabric and Power BI to support multi-developer collaboration, version control, and automated deployments. The Power BI Project (PBIP) format and native Git integration are foundational for this, transforming traditional .pbix files into human-readable text-based assets (JSON, TMDL, DAX) that are ideal for source control. This design note outlines a strategy for implementing a secure, efficient, and governed ALM pipeline.
Architecture Diagram Description & Data Flows The proposed architecture involves developers authoring Power BI projects in Desktop using the PBIP format. These projects, comprising semantic model (TMDL) and report definitions (JSON), are then committed to a Git repository (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitHub). A Fabric workspace is connected to this Git repository, enabling two-way synchronization of artifacts. Automated CI/CD pipelines orchestrated by Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions then validate and promote these artifacts across development, test, and production environments within the Power BI service. Data typically flows into OneLake, with semantic models leveraging Direct Lake mode for high-performance consumption.
3 Key Decisions

1. Source Control & Collaboration (PBIP + Git): Mandate the use of Power BI Project (PBIP) files for all Power BI Desktop projects. This text-based format enables efficient diffing, merging, and branching using standard Git practices (Azure DevOps, GitHub), facilitating multi-developer collaboration on semantic models and reports.
2. Deployment Automation (Fabric Deployment Pipelines): Implement service-orchestrated content promotion across Dev, Test, and Production workspaces using Power BI Deployment Pipelines via their dedicated REST API. This approach ensures consistent, atomic updates and is the Microsoft-endorsed method for ALM.
3. Data Isolation & Governance (RLS/Audiences): Employ a dual-layer security model by utilizing Row-Level Security (RLS) for granular data access within semantic models and Power BI App Audiences for controlled content distribution and user experience segmentation. This aligns with organizational roles and leverages OneLake's built-in governance capabilities for data protection.
Do/Don't
• DO:
    ◦ Enable the "Power BI Project (.pbip) save option" in Power BI Desktop's preview features for all developers.
    ◦ Use Git (Azure DevOps or GitHub) for source control of all PBIP-formatted semantic model and report files.
    ◦ Integrate the Best Practice Analyzer (BPA) and other validation tools (e.g., PBI-Inspector) directly into CI/CD pipelines.
    ◦ Configure Power BI Deployment Rules within the Power BI service to manage environment-specific configurations like data source connections and parameters.
• DON'T:
    ◦ Rely on the "Publish" button in Power BI Desktop for production deployments, as it bypasses critical ALM processes.
    ◦ Attempt to import .pbit (template) files via the general Power BI REST API Imports endpoint, as it does not support templates requiring interactive parameterization.
    ◦ Hardcode secrets, connection strings, or sensitive credentials directly in the Git repository; instead, use secure environment variables or Azure Key Vault.
Validation Steps (Exact Repo Paths + Commands)
1. Enable PBIP in Power BI Desktop: Navigate to File > Options and settings > Options > Global > Preview features and check the Power BI Project (.pbip) save option. Restart Power BI Desktop.
2. Save Project as PBIP: When saving, select File > Save As and choose Power BI Project File (*.pbip). This creates a folder structure for the semantic model and report.
3. Configure Git Ignore: In the root of your Git repository, create or update .gitignore to exclude temporary and user-specific files:
4. This content is derived from best practices for PBIP source control.
5. CI Validation with BPA (TMDL): Integrate the Tabular Editor CLI into your CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps) to validate semantic models:
    ◦ Install Tabular Editor CLI: dotnet tool install --global TabularEditor.CommandLine.
    ◦ Run BPA checks: te-cli -Bpa governance/GovernanceChecks.json semantic-model/model.tmdl -E.
    ◦ For general schema validation in CI, validate_catalog.py (located in tools/) can be used to ensure adherence to defined prompt schemas.
6. Automate Fabric Git Sync: For programmatic connection of a Git repository to a Fabric workspace, use the Fabric REST API (as noted in validation.json):
    ◦ POST <https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/git/connect>
Risks
• Dataflow Lifecycle Management: Microsoft Fabric's native Git integration currently does not support the synchronization of dataflow artifacts, requiring a separate, potentially manual, versioning and deployment process.
• Complex Test Automation: Setting up comprehensive UI and visual regression testing (e.g., using Playwright) for Power BI reports can be technically complex and resource-intensive. It is advisable to prioritize DAX and model-level validation first.
• Security & Credential Management: Improper handling of Service Principal credentials or a lack of robust pre-deployment approval gates for production environments can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.

This would allow you to quickly communicate the critical aspects of Query Folding's impact on performance, supported by visual guidance and direct references, aligning with your goal of effective strategic recommendations.

## USER QUESTION

“Mind map Direct Lake vs Import vs DirectQuery: criteria, pros/cons, when to switch, monitoring, and rollback plan (with file paths).”

## AI RESPONSE

In the ever-evolving landscape of Microsoft Fabric and Power BI, selecting the optimal semantic model connectivity mode is a critical decision that profoundly impacts performance, scalability, and cost. Understanding the nuances of Direct Lake, Import, and DirectQuery is key to architecting robust and efficient analytics solutions. This guide will help you navigate these choices, providing a clear framework for when to use each, how to transition between them, and how to ensure your solutions remain performant and resilient.
The Three Pillars of Connectivity: A Quick Overview
At the heart of Power BI semantic models lie three primary connectivity modes, each with distinct characteristics:
• Import Mode: This traditional mode loads all specified data directly into Power BI's highly compressed in-memory cache. It offers the fastest query performance and greatest DAX flexibility once data is loaded. Data is refreshed periodically.
• DirectQuery Mode: Instead of importing data, DirectQuery maintains a live connection to the source database. Queries issued by the report are translated and executed against the source in real-time. This mode is inherently slower and heavily dependent on the performance and network of the underlying source system.
• Direct Lake Mode: A cutting-edge Fabric-native mode, Direct Lake provides import-like performance by reading data directly from OneLake's Delta/Parquet tables without physically copying it. It acts as a bridge, giving you the speed of Import mode with the freshness of DirectQuery by leveraging the lake's native capabilities.
Choosing Your Path: Key Decision Criteria
Selecting the right mode isn't a one-size-fits-all decision; it depends on a combination of factors:
• Data Freshness (Latency Requirements):
    ◦ If up-to-the-minute, real-time data is a strict requirement, DirectQuery (if the source can handle the load) or Direct Lake (especially with real-time updates) are the primary candidates.
    ◦ For scenarios where data latency is acceptable (e.g., daily or hourly refreshes), Import mode or Direct Lake (with periodic refreshes) provides excellent performance.
• Data Volume & Volatility:
    ◦ Very large datasets or those with frequent changes often benefit from DirectQuery or Direct Lake, as importing everything might be infeasible or too slow to refresh.
    ◦ For stable, historical data that doesn't change often, Import mode is suitable. Direct Lake also handles large volumes efficiently with its architectural design, allowing for archival periods.
• Source System Capabilities & Load:
    ◦ A crucial consideration for DirectQuery and for Power Query transformations is query folding. Does your data source (e.g., relational database) support pushing query operations back to the source for efficient processing?. Sources like Salesforce APIs are typically poor candidates for DirectQuery due to inherent slowness and lack of folding support for complex operations. DirectQuery generally works best with relational databases that can handle the query load. Stored procedures are generally not supported in DirectQuery mode.
    ◦ The underlying source must be able to handle the concurrent query load generated by Power BI reports.
• Complexity & Skillset:
    ◦ Implementing advanced Fabric patterns like Lakehouse architectures with Direct Lake often requires skills in both Spark/Python and SQL. Hybrid tables, while powerful, add a layer of complexity to the model.
• Cost & Capacity:
    ◦ Features like Direct Lake, incremental refresh, and handling large models typically require Power BI Premium or Fabric F-SKUs. Monitoring Fabric capacity utilization and costs is vital for optimization.
Diving Deeper: Pros, Cons, and Use Cases
Direct Lake: The Fabric Advantage
Direct Lake is the recommended mode for many modern Power BI and Fabric implementations, especially when leveraging a Lakehouse.
• Pros:
    ◦ Provides import-like query performance by reading directly from Delta tables in OneLake.
    ◦ Eliminates data duplication, reducing storage and ETL complexity.
    ◦ Unifies analytics and data science workloads on a single platform (OneLake) with built-in governance and sensitivity labels.
    ◦ Seamlessly integrates with data science tools and offers exceptional BI performance.
• Cons:
    ◦ Requires data to be stored in OneLake, ideally in Delta format.
    ◦ Requires careful attention to naming conventions and ensuring data types align during ingestion into the Lakehouse.
    ◦ May have initial limitations for advanced concepts like calculation groups compared to Import mode.
• Use Cases:
    ◦ Medallion architectures (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) for structured data.
    ◦ Scenarios combining data engineering, data science, and BI on a unified data platform.
    ◦ Building logical data warehouses using OneLake Shortcuts to virtualize data without moving it.
Import Mode: Performance Powerhouse
Despite the emergence of Direct Lake, Import mode remains a cornerstone for many Power BI solutions.
• Pros:
    ◦ Offers the absolute fastest interactive query performance because data resides in-memory.
    ◦ Provides the greatest flexibility for DAX calculations, including complex time intelligence and custom logic.
    ◦ Less dependent on the performance of the source system once data is imported.
• Cons:
    ◦ Introduces data latency, as data is only as fresh as the last refresh.
    ◦ Semantic model size is constrained by available memory in the capacity.
    ◦ Requires periodic data refreshes, which consume capacity resources.
• Use Cases:
    ◦ General BI reporting where near real-time data isn't critical.
    ◦ Analyzing small to medium datasets that fit comfortably within capacity limits.
    ◦ When complex DAX is required, or the source system is too slow for DirectQuery.
DirectQuery: The Real-Time Gateway (Use with Caution)
DirectQuery serves a specific, critical niche, but demands careful implementation.
• Pros:
    ◦ Provides access to real-time data directly from the source.
    ◦ Leverages security defined in the underlying source system, especially with Single Sign-On (SSO).
    ◦ Avoids creating data caches in Power BI, addressing data sovereignty and security policies.
    ◦ Handles complex measures by pushing aggregation requests to the source, preventing unintended local aggregations.
• Cons:
    ◦ Slower query performance and interactive experience compared to Import or Direct Lake.
    ◦ Creates a hard dependency on the performance of the source system and network latency.
    ◦ Limitations on DAX functions and Power Query transformations (some steps break query folding).
    ◦ Not all data sources are good candidates; relational databases are typically better than API-based sources.
• Use Cases:
    ◦ Only when up-to-the-minute data is absolutely required and the source system can consistently handle concurrent query loads.
    ◦ Real-time streaming analytics, often in conjunction with KQL Databases and Data Activator.
    ◦ When strict data sovereignty rules prevent data caching in Power BI.
Navigating Transitions: When to Switch & Hybrid Approaches
Organizations often need to transition between modes or combine them for optimal results.
• From Azure Analysis Services (AAS) to Power BI Semantic Model:
    ◦ The model itself can often be moved by simply changing the endpoint from Azure AS to a Power BI capacity.
    ◦ Reports previously connected to the AAS model will need to be repointed to the new Power BI semantic model using the rebind API.
• Modernizing Existing Models to Direct Lake:
    ◦ For existing Import or DirectQuery models, the journey to Direct Lake involves migrating your data into OneLake in Delta format.
    ◦ Tools like Semantic Link Labs offer code samples and utilities that can assist with this transition for automating tasks related to Direct Lake models.
• Hybrid Tables for Balanced Performance:
    ◦ This advanced technique combines Import mode for historical or frequently accessed data with DirectQuery for real-time, recent data within a single table.
    ◦ It's particularly effective for large fact tables that need both historical depth and current freshness. Careful parameterization of Power Query (M) scripts and ensuring query folding are critical for performance.
• Aggregations to Speed Up DirectQuery:
    ◦ Create pre-aggregated tables in Import mode that sit on top of a DirectQuery source. Power BI can then answer high-level queries from the faster in-memory aggregation tables, only hitting the DirectQuery source for detailed drill-downs.
Monitoring and Maintaining Your Models
Once deployed, continuous monitoring is crucial to ensure your chosen mode continues to perform optimally:
• Performance Analyzer: Use Power BI Desktop's Performance Analyzer to identify slow visuals, DAX measures, and refresh bottlenecks.
• Query Diagnostics: Within the Power Query Editor, use Query Diagnostics to verify if query folding is occurring as expected. If folding breaks, it can significantly impact refresh performance.
• Best Practice Analyzer (BPA): Regularly run BPA checks for your semantic models to identify and remediate modeling, DAX, and Power Query anti-patterns that affect performance, governance, and maintainability.
• Fabric Capacity Metrics: Monitor your Fabric F-SKU capacity utilization and associated costs to ensure efficient resource usage and identify opportunities for optimization.
• Semantic Model Performance Reports: Generate reports to track key performance indicators such as refresh duration, query latency, and memory usage over time.
Your Safety Net: Rollback and Recovery
Robust ALM practices are essential for managing changes and recovering from issues:
• Version Control with Git and PBIP: The Power BI Project (.pbip) format stores semantic models and reports as human-readable text files, enabling effective version control, diffing, merging, and branching using Git (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitHub). This is foundational for quick rollbacks.
• Deployment Pipelines: Use Power BI Deployment Pipelines to manage the lifecycle of content across Development, Test, and Production workspaces. This provides a controlled environment for promotion and enables clear rollback strategies to previous, stable versions.
• OneLake Soft Delete: For data stored in Lakehouse files within OneLake, a soft delete feature retains deleted files for 7 days. This provides a critical recovery window, allowing restoration via Azure Storage Explorer or Semantic Link Labs.
• Automated Validation: Integrate tools like the Best Practice Analyzer (BPA) directly into your CI/CD pipelines. This ensures that governance policies and performance standards are met before deployment, catching potential issues early.
Code Example: M Query Parameterization for Flexibility
Parameterizing your Power Query (M) scripts is a key technique for supporting dynamic data sources, environment switching, and implementing flexible incremental refresh policies, particularly relevant for hybrid tables.
let
    // 1. Define these as Power Query parameters in the UI (e.g., prmServerName, prmDatabaseName, prmRangeStart, prmRangeEnd)
    //    prmServerName (Text, Required)
    //    prmDatabaseName (Text, Required)
    //    prmRangeStart (DateTime, Required) - for Incremental Refresh
    //    prmRangeEnd (DateTime, Required)   - for Incremental Refresh

    // 2. Use parameters for connection details
    Source = Sql.Database(prmServerName, prmDatabaseName),
    Data = Source{[Schema="dbo",Item="FactOrders"]}[Data],

    // 3. Use parameters for filter conditions (crucial for query folding in Incremental Refresh)
    #"Filtered Rows" = Table.SelectRows(Data, each [OrderDateTime] >= prmRangeStart and [OrderDateTime] < prmRangeEnd)
in
    #"Filtered Rows"
Note: This pattern facilitates dynamic environment switching during deployment pipelines and is foundational for Incremental Refresh and Hybrid Tables by pushing filters to the source. Ensure prmRangeStart and prmRangeEnd are correctly implemented with >= and < boundary conditions to prevent data duplication or loss during incremental refreshes.
Frequently Asked Questions
• Q: When should I exclusively use DirectQuery?
    ◦ A: Use DirectQuery only when up-to-the-minute data is an absolute requirement and your source system can handle the concurrent query load without performance degradation. For most other scenarios, Import or Direct Lake are generally preferred due to superior performance.
• Q: My Power Query refresh is taking a very long time. What's the first thing I should check?
    ◦ A: A slow Power Query refresh often indicates that query folding is broken. Examine your "Applied Steps" in Power Query Editor, reorder steps to keep foldable operations as early as possible, or consider pushing complex logic into a source-native SQL query using Value.NativeQuery.
• Q: Can I access a Power BI semantic model using Power Query if I only have "Viewer" permissions, not "Build"?
    ◦ A: No, you explicitly need "Build" permissions on a semantic model to connect to it and query its data using Power Query.
• Q: How do Lakehouse and Warehouse environments typically coexist within Microsoft Fabric?
    ◦ A: A common pattern is to leverage the Lakehouse for your medallion architecture layers (Bronze, Silver) and for data science workloads. For traditional BI consumption, you might then expose curated gold tables from the Lakehouse or create a dedicated Warehouse for T-SQL-first access.

## USER QUESTION

“Audio Overview (Debate style): ‘Performance vs Modeling Purity’ with two expert voices. Each point must reference a specific file and quote (paraphrase ok) before responding.”

## AI RESPONSE

Here is a 3-4 minute audio overview script, presented in a debate style, on "Performance vs Modeling Purity" for a Power BI lead, grounded solely in the provided sources.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Audio Intro Music fades in and out)
Narrator: Welcome, Power BI leads! Today, we're diving into a crucial debate that shapes every analytics solution in Microsoft Fabric and Power BI: "Performance versus Modeling Purity." Striking the right balance between these two goals is critical for scalable, maintainable, and cost-effective BI. We have two expert voices to guide us through this discussion.
Voice 1: Modeler Mark (Purity Advocate) "Good modeling practices are the bedrock of reliable and scalable Power BI solutions. My first principle is always the Star Schema. Violations like bidirectional filters between dimensions are generally incorrect in a star schema and can cause ambiguity and slow performance. We must simplify and flatten dimensions, for example, by merging related tables to improve efficiency, as highlighted in the best practices for star schema analysis." [guyincube.json.txt, prompt analyze-data-model-for-star-schema-best-practices, output section "Relationship Violations" and "Structure Issues",]
"Furthermore, for maintainability and a clean user experience, foreign keys should be hidden from the field list. This prevents clutter and guides users to the right information, a recommendation found in the Power BI Optimization Guide." [prompt-catalog.json.txt, prompt power-bi-optimization-guide, "Hide Foreign Keys",]
"And critically, robust DAX measures must use functions like DIVIDE instead of the / operator to handle potential division-by-zero errors gracefully. These aren't just coding standards; they ensure data integrity and user trust, as also recommended for DAX robustness." [prompt-catalog.json.txt, prompt power-bi-optimization-guide, "Use DIVIDE function",]
Voice 2: Architect Ada (Performance Advocate) "While purity is noble, real-world performance is paramount. For large datasets, blindly sticking to a rigid Import mode can be a disaster. We need to embrace techniques like Hybrid Tables. These allow you to 'cache part of a single table, like a fact table, in import mode, and then take a section of it and make it DirectQuery.' This combines the speed of import with the freshness of DirectQuery, which is key for optimizing performance on large data warehouses." [Power BI and Fabric Expert Guide (B).md.txt, directquery-optimization/transcript_quotes.jsonl, video HckuKYlx8kk at 00:24,]
"Aggregations are another powerful tool. By creating pre-aggregated tables, you can answer most queries from in-memory data while still allowing drill-down to detail via DirectQuery when necessary. This dramatically improves performance for summary reports, as detailed in our guidance." [Power BI and Fabric Expert Guide (C).md.txt, "DirectQuery Optimization (Hybrid Tables & Aggregations)",]
"And we can't ignore Power Query folding. Pushing transformations back to the source is vital. You can quickly check if query folding is happening by right-clicking the last step in your 'Applied Steps' and looking for the 'View Native Query' button. If it's enabled, folding is likely taking place." [Power BI and Fabric Expert Guide (B).md.txt, power-query-folding/transcript_quotes.jsonl, video QEFze-LdLqo at 01:41,]
"Finally, dynamic M parameters are critical. For example, by using a dynamic M parameter for a slicer, 'the query sent to the database is filtered to that region,' dramatically reducing data transfer in DirectQuery. Always push as much filtering as you can to the source." [Power BI and Fabric Expert Guide (C).md.txt, directquery-optimization/transcript_quotes.jsonl, video w8BPHvcjCh8 at 00:04:15,]
Voice 1: Modeler Mark (Rebuttal) "But sacrificing model purity for immediate performance can lead to unmaintainable 'spaghetti DAX' or inconsistent reporting. Complex iterative functions on large tables, like 'SUMX with a FILTER,' are doing row-by-row evaluation, which is inefficient. We can do better by rewriting it as CALCULATE with a filter expression, letting the engine handle it set-wise for faster results." [Power BI and Fabric Expert Guide (C).md.txt, dax-iterator/transcript_quotes.jsonl, video NA9pQdRN3F4 at 00:02:50,]
"We also need to centralize common measures. If you notice multiple users have implemented similar measures in different reports, there's an opportunity to 'centralize and have a single canonical version of that measure defined once in the model.' This is absolutely a best practice to ensure consistency and reusability." [-4GvHHCQJGE_REPLAY_Microsoft_Power_BI_Fabric_Q_A_-_LIVE_w_Matthew_Roche_April_26_2025.txt.txt,]
Voice 2: Architect Ada (Rebuttal) "I agree on DAX optimization and centralizing measures. However, the semantic model mode itself is a performance decision. If you have a highly transactional source or need real-time data, DirectQuery is a solution, but be aware that not all sources are good candidates. For instance, 'using DirectQuery against a Salesforce piece, it's similar to a REST API or something. Why would you want to do DirectQuery on that? It's going to be very slow.' You must assess the source's capability." [tu9--dEPMic_REPLAY_Microsoft_Power_BI_Fabric_Q_A_-_LIVE_Aug_2_2025.json.txt,]
"And remember, capacity consumption is on the semantic model. An unoptimized or 'heavy' semantic model will drive significant F-SKU costs, even if reports are in a Pro workspace. You should always try to make your semantic model beautiful to manage consumption effectively." [i2dGafRFxhc_REPLAY_Microsoft_Power_BI_Fabric_Q_A_-_LIVE_May_3_2025.json.txt,]
Narrator: As you've heard, both performance and modeling purity are essential. The best approach often involves a thoughtful balance, leveraging the right tools and techniques for your specific data, user needs, and organizational context. Your strategic recommendations should reflect this nuanced understanding.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action Items for Your Power BI Team:

1. Conduct a Model Purity Audit: Review existing semantic models for star schema adherence. Specifically, identify and resolve any bidirectional relationships between dimensions and instances of snowflaking to improve both data integrity and query performance. [guyincube.json.txt, prompt analyze-data-model-for-star-schema-best-practices,]
2. Optimize Large Datasets with Hybrid Strategies: For large fact tables or those requiring a balance of freshness and performance, evaluate and implement hybrid tables or aggregations. This involves caching historical data in Import mode while keeping recent data in DirectQuery. [Power BI and Fabric Expert Guide (B).md.txt, directquery-optimization/transcript_quotes.jsonl, video HckuKYlx8kk,]
3. Implement Power Query Folding Validation: Regularly audit Power Query transformations to ensure query folding is occurring. Prioritize pushing data transformations back to the source where possible, and use dynamic M parameters for filtering to optimize DirectQuery performance. [Power BI and Fabric Expert Guide (C).md.txt, directquery-optimization/transcript_quotes.jsonl, video w8BPHvcjCh8 at 00:04:15,]
Validation Command: To integrate model quality and performance checks into your CI/CD pipeline, you can use the Tabular Editor CLI with a Best Practice Analyzer (BPA) ruleset: te-cli -Bpa governance/GovernanceChecks.json semantic-model/model.tmdl -E [prompt-catalog.json.txt, prompt design-adversarial-test-plan-ai-prompts,]

## USER QUESTION

“Generate a 90-second Video Overview: ‘Speed up Power Query with folding-first patterns’. Include title card, 3 slides (Problem → Pattern → Validate), captions, and end slide with repo paths & commands. Use only the provided sources.”

## AI RESPONSE

Here is a script for a 90-second Audio Overview on "Speed up Power Query with folding-first patterns" for a Power BI lead.
(Video Start: Title Card - 5 seconds) Visual: "Speed up Power Query: Folding-First Patterns for Performance"
(Audio Start)
(Slide 1: Problem → Slow Refreshes & Inefficient Processing - 25 seconds) Visual: Slide with text: "Problem: Slow Refreshes, Inefficient Data Movement" Captions: "Is Power Query slowing you down? Query folding is key." "Without it, all data moves to memory for local processing." "This impacts refresh times and scalability for large models."
(Audio) "Hello Power BI Leads. Let's talk about a critical performance bottleneck: slow Power Query refreshes. The core issue often lies in what we call 'query folding.' When Power Query can't 'fold' or translate its transformations back to the source database, it's forced to pull all your data into memory to perform those operations locally. This is incredibly inefficient, impacts refresh duration, and significantly hampers scalability, especially with large datasets. It's like manually driving every single package across town instead of letting a high-speed train do the work."
(Slide 2: Pattern → Design for Folding-First - 30 seconds) Visual: Slide with text: "Pattern: Design for Folding-First" Captions: "Filter & select early: Push operations to the source." "Reorder steps: Non-foldable transforms last." "Leverage native queries & parameters for complex logic."
(Audio) "The solution is to adopt a 'folding-first' pattern in your Power Query M steps. First, always filter and select columns as early as possible in your query. These operations like Table.SelectRows and Table.SelectColumns nearly always translate directly into WHERE clauses and column selections at the source, dramatically reducing the data transferred. Second, reorder your steps. If you must perform a non-foldable transformation, such as adding an index column, do it after all other foldable operations. This ensures the dataset in memory is as small as possible. Finally, leverage native queries and parameters for complex scenarios. Functions like Value.NativeQuery with [EnableFolding=true] are crucial for optimizing stored procedure execution and pushing dynamic filters from slicers back to the source, like WHERE RegionID = X, enabling powerful DirectQuery optimizations."
(Slide 3: Validate → Confirm & Monitor Folding - 25 seconds) Visual: Slide with text: "Validate: Confirm & Monitor Folding" Captions: "Use 'View Native Query' in Power Query Editor." "Utilize 'Query Diagnostics' to pinpoint folding breaks." "Integrate automated checks into CI/CD pipelines."
(Audio) "Once you’ve applied these patterns, validation is key. Don’t assume; confirm. The primary way to verify is by right-clicking the last applied step in the Power Query Editor and checking the 'View Native Query' option. If it's enabled, folding is likely active. For deeper insights, use Power Query's 'Query Diagnostics' tool to pinpoint exactly where folding might be breaking. For ongoing governance, consider integrating automated checks into your CI/CD pipelines to validate M code quality and ensure folding is preserved, catching issues before they impact users."
(End Slide: Action Items & Validation - 5 seconds) Visual: Slide with text: "Next Steps:", "1. Audit critical Power Query operations for folding breaks.", "2. Refactor existing queries: Prioritize filtering and column selection early.", "3. Implement dynamic M Query Parameters for DirectQuery models.", "Validation: python tools/build_powerbi_catalogue.py --validate" Captions: "Action: Audit existing queries for folding breaks." "Action: Refactor for early filtering and column selection." "Action: Implement Dynamic M Query Parameters." "Validation: Run catalogue validation to ensure guidance consistency."
(Audio) "Here are three immediate action items:

1. Audit existing queries: Use Power Query’s built-in tools to identify any non-folding steps in your critical dataflows.
2. Refactor for early folding: Prioritize filters and column selections as early as possible in your M code, reordering non-foldable steps to the end.
3. Implement dynamic M Query Parameters: For large DirectQuery models, use parameters to push user-driven filters directly to the source for optimized performance.
And a validation command for your system's guidance: python tools/build_powerbi_catalogue.py --validate
Thank you."

## USER QUESTION

“Create a Learning Guide for ‘FabricAgent Prompt Quality’ with modules: Schemas, GIAC-derived prompts, CI validation, and governance. Add 5 reflection questions and a mini-project using schemas/prompt.schema.json.”

## AI RESPONSE

Here is a Learning Guide for 'FabricAgent Prompt Quality', designed to help Power BI leads and practitioners understand and uphold the high standards of prompts within the FabricAgent ecosystem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learning Guide: FabricAgent Prompt Quality
Welcome to this learning guide on ensuring high quality for prompts within FabricAgent. FabricAgent is a pragmatic, vendor-neutral AI assistant designed to help organizations confidently design, build, and operate Microsoft Fabric and Power BI solutions. Its core mission is to embed quality from day one, reducing rework and ensuring compliance. This guide will walk you through the key aspects of prompt quality: schema validation, leveraging curated content, integrating with CI/CD, and overall governance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module 1: Schemas – The Blueprint for Quality
What it is: Schemas define the expected structure, content, and safety parameters for every prompt in the FabricAgent catalog. Specifically, the schemas/prompt.schema.json file serves as the strict blueprint that all prompts must adhere to. This schema dictates elements like id, name, persona, description, tags, system and user_template instructions, and crucial safety configurations including safety_clause, disallowed keywords, and fallbacks.
Why it matters for prompt quality: Schema validation is a critical "quality gate". If a prompt does not validate against the schema, it "does not ship". This ensures consistency, predictability, and reliability across all prompts, making them easier to manage, extend, and integrate into automated workflows. It prevents malformed prompts from entering the system, which could lead to unpredictable or unsafe AI agent behavior.
Key Quote: "Prompt definitions validate against schemas/prompt.schema.json. If it does not validate, it does not ship".
Relevant File Paths:
• schemas/prompt.schema.json
• prompts/powerbi/prompt-catalog.json

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module 2: GIAC-Derived Prompts – Leveraging Expert Knowledge
What it is: FabricAgent utilizes a "continuous prompt pipeline" that ingests approved transcripts from sources like Guy in a Cube (GIAC) videos, distills them into optimized prompts, and publishes them to the catalog. These are explicitly marked as "GIAC-derived prompts". The pipeline ensures that these are not just raw transcript dumps, but concise, schema-validated prompts with exact video citations and timestamp ranges.
Why it matters for prompt quality: This process directly addresses the challenge of keeping pace with modern analytics by continuously harvesting expertise from trusted sources. It provides users with access to proven best practices and troubleshooting tips for Power BI and Fabric, directly integrated into the prompt catalog. By distilling specific segments and citing them, it maintains provenance and allows users to refer back to the original expert content.
Key Quote: "An optional job ingests approved transcripts (for example, Guy in a Cube), distills them into DAG-optimized prompts, validates against schemas, optionally embeds for semantic search, and publishes to prompts/ automatically. Outputs are idempotent and CI-safe".
Relevant File Paths:
• prompts/powerbi/giac/ (directory for GIAC-derived prompts)
• prompts_out/published/index.jsonl (app-ready index of prompts and artifacts)
• guyincube.json.txt (catalog of GIAC-derived prompts)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module 3: CI Validation – Automating Quality Assurance
What it is: Continuous Integration (CI) is central to FabricAgent's quality strategy. It means that prompt quality is enforced automatically throughout the development lifecycle, typically in Pull Requests (PRs) before changes are merged. This includes:
• Schema Validation: Every new or modified prompt is automatically validated against schemas/prompt.schema.json to ensure structural integrity.
• Adversarial Testing: For critical AI prompts, adversarial test plans are designed to validate safety, reliability, and governance compliance by attempting to bypass guardrails or elicit unsafe responses. This plan can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline using tools like validate_catalog.py.
Why it matters for prompt quality: CI validation builds "confidence" in the prompt catalog by ensuring that "quality is built in, not bolted on". It identifies issues early, reduces manual review cycles, and maintains a "governance integrity". The "same checks you run by hand can run in PRs - consistent, repeatable, auditable". This automated process significantly reduces the risk of deploying flawed or unsafe prompts.
Key Quote: "CI-first. Works locally and in GitHub Actions. The same checks you run by hand can run in PRs - consistent, repeatable, auditable".
Relevant File Paths:
• tools/validate_catalog.py (mentioned as a tool for schema validation in CI)
• dags/ (pipeline definitions for automated processes)
• prompts_out/ (outputs from the prompt pipeline)
• workflow-pipeline prompt system instruction ("Illustrate the contributor workflow: Author prompt → Schema & safety validation → Merge via CI → Catalog published → Agents consume catalog. Use a left-to-right pipeline with callouts for CI checks.")

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module 4: Governance – The Foundation of Trust
What it is: FabricAgent is designed with a "governance-first AI approach". This means that safety, control, and auditability are embedded into the very fabric of the prompt catalog and its workflows. Key governance features include:
• Safety Clauses: Each prompt includes explicit safety_clause instructions, disallowed actions, and fallbacks to prevent harmful or inappropriate outputs. This ensures responsible AI principles are upheld.
• Mandatory Human Validation: While automation is key, there's a strong emphasis on "mandatory human validation of AI-generated outputs" and "trust but verify". AI outputs, like DAX, need to be validated.
• Role-Based Access: Governance extends to who can manage and use prompts, ensuring appropriate permissions for different user personas (e.g., Power BI leads, prompt engineers, AI developers, enterprise organizations).
Why it matters for prompt quality: Robust governance ensures that the AI assistant acts predictably, safely, and in alignment with organizational standards. It mitigates risks like "hallucination", "inaccurate DAX generation, data leakage, [and] prompt injection". A "deny-by-default security posture" is emphasized for AI safety. This builds "trust" and "confidence" for enterprise deployment.
Key Quote: "The proposal must prioritize safety, reliability, and human oversight. Ensure that AI-driven actions are validated and auditable. Do not propose AI solutions that make irreversible decisions or modifications without explicit human approval".
Relevant File Paths:
• prompt-catalog.json.txt (contains numerous safety clauses for various prompts)
• workforce_prompts.json.txt (includes detailed safety configurations for workforce prompts)
• develop-training-ai-safety-guardrails prompt system instruction ("Develop a training module outline focused on AI safety guardrails for {audience} using AI tools within Microsoft Fabric. ... Mandatory human validation of AI-generated outputs.")
• FabricAgent: AI for Governed Analytics and Power BI ("Control: safety clauses, blocked vendor terms, and secret-aware scans built into the flow.")

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reflection Questions

1. How does schemas/prompt.schema.json directly impact your daily workflow when creating or modifying a Power BI-related prompt? What are the benefits and potential challenges?
2. Considering the emphasis on GIAC-derived prompts, how might you ensure that internal expert knowledge within your organization is captured and distilled into FabricAgent prompts effectively, following similar quality standards?
3. If a new Power BI feature is released, what steps would you take to ensure that prompts related to that feature are quickly brought up to the FabricAgent's CI validation standards, including schema validation and potential adversarial testing?
4. Beyond the technical aspects, how can you foster a "governance-first" culture among your Power BI developers and data professionals to ensure they actively adhere to FabricAgent's prompt quality and safety guidelines?
5. Imagine a scenario where a prompt's fallback mechanism is frequently triggered. What might this indicate about the prompt's design or the underlying AI model, and what steps would you take to address it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mini-Project: Extending a Prompt with Validation
Objective: Understand how to modify and validate a prompt against the schemas/prompt.schema.json.
Scenario: You need to add a new tag to an existing prompt in the prompt-catalog.json to improve its discoverability for a new "FinOps" initiative.
Steps:

1. Identify a Target Prompt:
    ◦ Open prompts/powerbi/prompt-catalog.json.
    ◦ Choose a prompt that currently does not have a "FinOps" tag. For example, power-bi-optimization-guide (ID: power-bi-optimization-guide).
2. Review the Schema (Mentally or by Inspection):
    ◦ Examine schemas/prompt.schema.json to understand the expected structure of the tags array (e.g., must be an array of strings).
3. Propose a Modification:
    ◦ Locate the power-bi-optimization-guide prompt in prompts/powerbi/prompt-catalog.json.
    ◦ Add "finops" to its tags array.
4. Validate the Change:
    ◦ You would typically run the schema validation tool to confirm your modification is compliant. While you don't have direct access to run validate_catalog.py in this environment, the command is:
    ◦ This command, as referenced in prompts like design-adversarial-test-plan-ai-prompts, ensures that prompt-catalog.json adheres to schemas/prompt.schema.json. If you made a typo (e.g., tag instead of tags), the validation would fail.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This learning guide provides a solid foundation for understanding and contributing to the quality of prompts within FabricAgent.

## USER QUESTION

“Make 20 flashcards from the DAX performance docs and GIAC prompts. Front: scenario; Back: best-practice answer + reference file path.”

## AI RESPONSE

Here are 20 flashcards focused on DAX performance, drawing from the provided Power BI and Fabric documentation and Guy in a Cube (GIAC) prompts:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flashcards: DAX Performance Optimization

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flashcard 1/20
• Front: Your DAX measure, Total Sales (Iterative) := SUMX(FactSales, FactSales[Quantity] * FactSales[UnitPrice]), is running slowly on a large fact table.
• Back: Best Practice: Refactor the measure to avoid explicit iteration over large tables within DAX. Instead, leverage CALCULATE and aggregators, or push calculations upstream.
    ◦ Reference: prompt-catalog.json.txt, workforce_prompts.json.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flashcard 2/20
• Front: A DAX measure calculating Sales USA := CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), FILTER(ALL(Customers), Customer[Country] = "USA")) is slow, specifically due to iterating over a large Customers table.
• Back: Best Practice: Replace FILTER(ALL(Table), ...) with a direct filter on the column using KEEPFILTERS(Table[Column] = "Value") to prevent materializing the entire table for iteration.
    ◦ Reference: prompt-catalog.json.txt, workforce_prompts.json.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flashcard 3/20
• Front: DAX Studio performance metrics show that a query spends 96% of its time in the Formula Engine (FE) and only 4% in the Storage Engine (SE).
• Back: Best Practice: This indicates a severe FE bottleneck, often caused by complex iterators or materialized intermediate tables. Refactor DAX to utilize set-based operations and functions that push work efficiently to the Storage Engine.
    ◦ Reference: prompt-catalog.json.txt, workforce_prompts.json.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flashcard 4/20
• Front: You need a calculation that must be reusable across different visuals or reports, or relies on complex model relationships outside a single visual's scope.
• Back: Best Practice: Use an explicit DAX measure. Measures provide reusability and full access to the entire data model, unlike visual calculations which are limited to the fields already in the visual.
    ◦ Reference: 5I8yzn8oDAo_STOP_Using_Measures_in_Power_BI_Until_You_See_This.json.txt, 5I8yzn8oDAo_STOP_Using_Measures_in_Power_BI_Until_You_See_This.txt.txt, guyincube.json.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flashcard 5/20
• Front: You are migrating a Power BI report with report-level measures, previously live-connected to an Azure Analysis Services model, to a new Power BI semantic model.
• Back: Best Practice: You will need to use scripting tools like Tabular Editor to copy these report-level measures into the new Power BI semantic model.
    ◦ Reference: Excerpts from "-4GvHHCQJGE_REPLAY_Microsoft_Power_BI_Fabric_Q_A_-_LIVE_w_Matthew_Roche_April_26_2025.txt.txt"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flashcard 6/20
• Front: A simple aggregation (like summing a column) is being performed using an iterative function (e.g., SUMX) in DAX.
• Back: Best Practice: Prefer set-based functions such as CALCULATE(SUM(...)) over iterative functions like SUMX for simple aggregations, as they are generally more efficient and better optimized by the VertiPaq engine.
    ◦ Reference: Power BI and Fabric Expert Guide (B).md.txt, evidence/dax-iterator-optimization/transcript_quotes.jsonl, guyincube.json.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flashcard 7/20
• Front: Your DAX measure [Profit Margin] uses the direct division operator (/), which could result in division-by-zero errors.
• Back: Best Practice: Always use the DIVIDE function in DAX for division operations. It safely handles division by zero by allowing you to specify an alternative result (e.g., BLANK() or 0).
    ◦ Reference: prompt-catalog.json.txt, workforce_prompts.json.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flashcard 8/20
• Front: Foreign key columns are visible in the Power BI Desktop field list, cluttering the user experience and potentially confusing end-users.
• Back: Best Practice: Hide foreign key columns by setting their IsHidden property to True in the model. This keeps the model clean for report authors and consumers.
    ◦ Reference: prompt-catalog.json.txt, workforce_prompts.json.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flashcard 9/20
• Front: A bidirectional relationship exists between a dimension table (DimCustomer) and a fact table (FactSales), causing ambiguous filter propagation and performance issues.
• Back: Best Practice: Change the 'Cross filter direction' from 'Both' to 'Single' (e.g., DimCustomer filters FactSales). Only use CROSSFILTER(..., Both) sparingly within specific CALCULATE statements when truly necessary to override this.
    ◦ Reference: prompt-catalog.json.txt, workforce_prompts.json.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flashcard 10/20
• Front: You have a complex DAX formula where certain expressions are repeated multiple times, making the code harder to read, debug, and potentially less performant.
• Back: Best Practice: Use variables (VAR) in your DAX formulas to store intermediate results. This improves readability, simplifies debugging, and enhances performance by evaluating the expression only once.
    ◦ Reference: dax-library.json.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flashcard 11/20

## AI RESPONSE

Here is a 10-question quiz on Row-Level Security (RLS) versus Power BI App Audiences, grounded solely in the provided sources.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quiz: RLS vs. Power BI App Audiences

1. Question: What is the primary function of Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI? Answer: RLS primarily filters rows in semantic models to control which data a user can see.
2. Question: What is the primary function of Power BI App Audiences? Answer: Power BI App Audiences control which reports or dashboards a user can see within an app.
3. Question: Can Power BI App Audiences filter the underlying data in a report? Answer: No, Audiences only control the visibility of content (reports/pages) and do not filter the underlying data.
4. Question: For which workspace roles is Row-Level Security (RLS) enforced? Answer: RLS is only enforced for users assigned the Viewer role in the workspace.
5. Question: What is a significant pitfall if you rely on Power BI App Audiences for data security? Answer: Relying on Audiences for data security can lead to data leaks because they only hide content, not filter the underlying data.
6. Question: How can RLS and Power BI App Audiences be used together effectively? Answer: RLS can secure confidential data at the row level on the dataset, while App Audiences can be used to hide entire pages or reports from certain groups, providing both data and content control.
7. Question: What is a common practice for assigning users to RLS roles to ensure enforcement? Answer: To enforce RLS, business users should be assigned the Viewer role in production workspaces.
8. Question: What is the recommended way to test if RLS is working as expected? Answer: RLS roles can be tested using the "View as role" feature in both Power BI Desktop and the Power BI Service.
9. Question: In a multi-tenant application scenario, which security feature is crucial for data isolation? Answer: Row-Level Security (RLS) is crucial for data isolation in multi-tenant applications, allowing each client to see only their specific data.
10. Question: Does applying RLS typically introduce any performance considerations? Answer: Yes, dynamic RLS may introduce query overhead, potentially increasing query duration by 15-30% in complex models.

This leads to logic being scattered across multiple Power BI Desktop files, risking inconsistencies and rework. Dataflows provide a solution for centralizing this logic once for reuse across many models.\n\n## Solution: Implementing a Dataflow for DimCustomer\n\n### 1. Create the Dataflow in Fabric Workspace\n- Navigate to your Power BI or Fabric workspace.\n- Click 'New' -> 'Dataflow Gen2'.\n- Add your data source (e.g., SQL Database -> DimCustomer table).\n\n### 2. Apply Transformations (M Code Conceptual Example)\n```m\nlet\n    Source = Sql.Database(\"YourServer\", \"YourDatabase\"),\n    DimCustomer = Source{[Schema=\"dbo\",Item=\"DimCustomer\"]}[Data],\n    // Example: Add Gender column from a numerical code\n    #\"Added Gender\" = Table.AddColumn(DimCustomer, \"Gender\", each if [GenderCode] = 1 then \"Male\" else \"Female\", type text),\n    // Example: Standardize Salary Range\n    #\"Added Salary Range\" = Table.AddColumn(#\"Added Gender\", \"SalaryRange\", each \n        if [AnnualSalary] < 30000 then \"Low\" \n        else if [AnnualSalary] < 70000 then \"Medium\" \n        else \"High\", type text)\nin\n    #\"Added Salary Range\"\n```\n*Note: This M code is illustrative. Actual steps will vary based on your `transformation_description`. Avoid native queries where standard M functions can be used to maximize query folding.* \n\n### 3. Save and Refresh the Dataflow\n- Save the Dataflow with a descriptive name (e.g., 'CoreCustomerData').\n- Configure a scheduled refresh for the Dataflow to ensure data freshness.\n\n### 4. Consume the Dataflow in Power BI Desktop\n- In Power BI Desktop, go to 'Get Data' -> 'Power BI dataflows'.\n- Select your workspace and the 'CoreCustomerData' Dataflow table.\n- Load the data into your semantic model. This ensures all reports using this Dataflow table leverage the same, centralized logic.\n\n## Validation Checklist\n- [ ] Dataflow successfully created and refreshed.\n- [ ] All specified transformations are correctly applied in the Dataflow.\n- [ ] Query folding is maximized for all steps in the Dataflow.\n- [ ] Power BI semantic models successfully connect to and consume the Dataflow output.\n- [ ] Data consistency verified across multiple reports using the centralized Dataflow."

## USER QUESTION

“Write a 6-post LinkedIn thread summarizing our Query Folding guide with one insight per post, a micro-example, and a repo citation.”

## AI RESPONSE

Here is a 6-post LinkedIn thread summarizing our Query Folding guide, with one insight per post, a micro-example, and a repository citation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LinkedIn Thread: Mastering Power Query Folding for Performance
Post 1/6
Insight: Query folding is a fundamental performance optimization in Power Query. It pushes data transformations back to the source database, significantly reducing data movement and increasing efficiency. This means your data source does the heavy lifting, not your local machine or Power BI service.
Micro-example: When you use Table.SelectRows (like filtering data by a date range), Power Query tries to convert this into a WHERE clause in the source SQL query.
Citation: guide-to-power-query-folding.md.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Post 2/6
Insight: Diagnosing query folding is crucial. A quick way to verify if folding is happening is to use the "View Native Query" option directly in the Power Query Editor. If it's enabled, it's highly likely that your transformations are being pushed to the source.
Micro-example: In Power Query Editor, right-click the last step in the "Applied Steps" pane and check if "View Native Query" is active.
Citation: Power BI and Fabric Expert Guide (B).md.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Post 3/6
Insight: Be aware of common anti-patterns that "break the fold." Once folding is broken, all subsequent steps are processed locally in Power Query's engine, often leading to a full download of the source data. A prime example is adding an index column.
Micro-example: Applying Table.AddIndexColumn early in your query can prevent subsequent filtering or sorting from being folded to the data source.
Citation: prompt-catalog.json.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Post 4/6
Insight: To fix broken folding, a powerful pattern is strategic step reordering. Move all foldable transformations (like filtering, column selection, or simple merges) to occur before any non-foldable operations. This maximizes the work done by the source database.
Micro-example: If you need to filter data and then add an index, ensure the Table.SelectRows step is placed before Table.AddIndexColumn in your applied steps.
Citation: prompt-catalog.json.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Post 5/6
Insight: For advanced scenarios, such as executing stored procedures or needing precise SQL control, Value.NativeQuery can be used. Critically, ensure you include [EnableFolding=true] to explicitly tell Power Query to push that native query back to the source for execution.
Micro-example: Result = Value.NativeQuery(Source, "EXEC dbo.GetReportData @Param='Value'", null, [EnableFolding=true])
Citation: guyincube.json.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Post 6/6
Insight: Query folding is not a "set it and forget it" feature. Continuous monitoring with Query Diagnostics, testing against your specific data sources, and staying updated with new Fabric connector behaviors are essential to maintain optimal performance and accuracy.
Micro-example: Periodically use Power Query Editor's "Query Diagnostics" to generate a step-by-step trace and identify any unexpected folding breaks that might arise from data source changes or Power Query updates.
