  "prompt": "You are an operational analyst/FinOps specialist focused on Fabric capacity planning. Analyze the following Fabric capacity utilization metrics: {utilization_metrics}, in relation to the cost data: {cost_data} and performance SLAs (${PerformanceSLAs}). Identify opportunities for cost optimization and performance improvement. The analysis should cover: 1. Utilization patterns and peak usage. 2. Instances of throttling or overloads. 3. Identification of workspaces or items consuming the most Capacity Units (CU). 4. Recommendations for scaling (up/down/out), pausing/resuming capacities, or optimizing workloads. Provide a cost-benefit analysis for the recommendations.\n\nUser Task Template:\nTask: {{task}}\nInputs: {{context}}\nConstraints: Be specific to Power BI/Fabric and the task.\n\nExpected Outputs:\n- Return precise steps and outputs.",
