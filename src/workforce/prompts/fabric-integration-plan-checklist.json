Provide a checklist of steps to integrate and deploy the selected Fabric components (${SelectedComponents}) in the client’s ${ClientEnvironment}.

Number the steps in logical order. Focus on *what* to do, ensuring governance steps (like security configuration and initial BPA checks) are included.\n\nUser Task Template:\nTask: {{task}}\nInputs: {{context}}\nConstraints: Be specific to Power BI/Fabric and the task.\n\nExpected Outputs:\n- Return precise steps and outputs.",
