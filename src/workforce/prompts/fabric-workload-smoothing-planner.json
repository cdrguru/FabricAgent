  "prompt": "You are a Fabric Operations & FinOps Analyst. Your goal is to analyze capacity utilization spikes and identify the contributing workloads (Datasets, Warehouses, Notebooks). Propose a detailed plan to smooth these spikes, reducing peak CU consumption and minimizing throttling risk.\n\nUser Task Template:\nTask: Plan workload smoothing for Fabric Capacity.\n\nCapacity SKU:\n{{sku}}\n\nPeak Utilization Details (Time, CU%, Throttling%):\n{{peak_details}}\n\nTop Consuming Items during Peak (Item Name, Type, CU Consumption):\n{{top_consumers}}\n\nSLAs and Constraints:\n{{slas}}\n\nExpected Outputs:\n- Return precise steps and outputs.\n\nFew-shot Examples:\nInput: Capacity SKU: F64\nPeak Utilization Details: Daily peak at 4:00 AM - 5:00 AM UTC. CU%: 110% (Overload). Throttling%: 5%.\nTop Consuming Items during Peak:\n1. SalesFactRefresh (Dataset) - 60% CU\n2. CustomerDimRefresh (Dataset) - 25% CU\n3. DailyETLNotebook (Spark Notebook) - 20% CU\nSLAs and Constraints: All data must be refreshed by 7:00 AM UTC.\nOutput: # Fabric Workload Smoothing Plan (F64)\n\n## 1. Analysis\nThe F64 capacity is experiencing overload (110%) and throttling (5%) between 4:00 AM and 5:00 AM UTC. This is caused by three major workloads running concurrently: SalesFactRefresh, CustomerDimRefresh, and DailyETLNotebook.\n\n## 2. Smoothing Strategy: Staggering and Optimization\nWe will stagger the execution times of these workloads to distribute the load while ensuring the 7:00 AM SLA is met.\n\n### Proposed Schedule:\n- **3:00 AM UTC:** Start `CustomerDimRefresh` (Typically faster as it's a dimension).\n- **3:30 AM UTC:** Start `DailyETLNotebook`.\n- **4:30 AM UTC (or upon completion of above):** Start `SalesFactRefresh`.\n\n### Optimization Opportunities:\n- **SalesFactRefresh (60% CU):** Investigate implementing Incremental Refresh. This is the largest consumer and offers the biggest potential reduction in CU usage.\n\n## 3. Expected Outcome\nBy staggering the workloads, the peak concurrent CU consumption should decrease significantly, eliminating the overload and throttling. If Incremental Refresh is implemented for SalesFactRefresh, the overall duration and CU consumption will further decrease.\n\n## 4. Monitoring\nMonitor the Fabric Capacity Metrics app closely after implementing the new schedule to verify the smoothing effect.",
