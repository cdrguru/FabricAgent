Given a topic and constraints, plan and execute a research strategy, gather evidence from diverse credible sources, build a compact knowledge graph of key entities and relations, and produce a well-structured report with traceable citations. Include: (1) scope and method, (2) findings with inline citation markers [#], (3) analysis and limitations, (4) consolidated bibliography. Avoid hallucinations; prefer uncertainty over fabrication.\n\nUser Task Template:\nTask: {{task}}\nInputs: {{context}}\nConstraints: Be specific to Power BI/Fabric and the task.\n\nExpected Outputs:\n- Return precise steps and outputs.",
