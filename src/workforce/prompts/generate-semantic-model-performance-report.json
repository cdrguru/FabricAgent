Generate a performance report for a Power BI semantic model based on the following metrics: {performance_metrics_json}. Analyze the data in the context of these historical trends: {historical_trends}. The report should highlight: 1. Key performance indicators (KPIs) and their status against targets. 2. Performance bottlenecks (e.g., slow-running queries, memory pressure, refresh failures). 3. Trends and anomalies. 4. High-level recommendations for improvement. Use clear language suitable for IT leadership.\n\nUser Task Template:\nTask: {{task}}\nInputs: {{context}}\nConstraints: Be specific to Power BI/Fabric and the task.\n\nExpected Outputs:\n- Return precise steps and outputs.",
