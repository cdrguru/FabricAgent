Uses the default theme. Contains a dense matrix visual and several card visuals. Navigation is handled by buttons on the left side.\nOutput: # Accessibility and UX Review\n\n## Issues List\n1. **Color Contrast (Potential):** The default Power BI theme often has contrast issues with certain color combinations. (WCAG 1.4.3)\n2. **Tab Order (Likely):** The tab order likely follows visual placement rather than logical flow (left navigation first, then main content).\n3. **Alt Text (Likely):** Card visuals and matrix visuals often lack descriptive Alt Text.\n4. **Keyboard Navigation (Matrix):** Dense matrix visuals can be difficult to navigate using a keyboard.\n\n## Remediation Guide\n1. **Color Contrast:** Use a contrast checker tool (e.g., Colour Contrast Analyser) to verify all text/background combinations. Switch to a high-contrast theme if necessary.\n2. **Tab Order:** Open the 'Selection' pane in Power BI Desktop. Go to the 'Tab order' view. Reorder elements so the navigation buttons are first, followed by the main content visuals in a logical sequence.\n3. **Alt Text:** Select each visual. In the 'Format' pane under 'General' > 'Alt Text', provide a concise description of the visual's content (e.g., \"Total Sales YTD: $1.2M\").\n4. **Keyboard Navigation:** Consider simplifying the matrix visual or providing a summarized table alternative if the matrix is too complex for keyboard users.\n\nInput: context=Report with low-contrast palette\nOutput: Recommend contrast-safe theme, alt text, and tab order.",

This forces the Formula Engine to iterate over the table within `FILTER` before aggregation, bypassing efficient Storage Engine scans.\n\n## 2. Optimized DAX\n```dax\n[Total Sales (Optimized)] :=\nCALCULATE(\n    SUM(FactInternetSales[SalesAmount]),\n    FactInternetSales[OrderDate] >= DATE(2024, 1, 1)\n)\n```\n\n## 3. Rationale\nUsing `CALCULATE(SUM(...), filter_condition)` allows the VertiPaq engine to apply the filter context directly during the Storage Engine scan, significantly reducing the data materialized.\n\n## 4. Validation Plan\n1. Deploy both measures.\n2. Verify results are identical across various filter contexts.\n3. Use Performance Analyzer to compare the DAX Query times.\n\nInput: Task: Analyze and optimize the following DAX measure.\n\nMeasure Name: Sales USA (Slow)\nTable: Sales\n\nDAX Code (artifact):\n```dax\nSales USA (Slow) := CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), FILTER(ALL(Customers), Customer[Country] = \"USA\"))\n```\n\nModel Context (context):\nSales table: 100M rows. Customers table: 1M rows. 1-to-many relationship.\nOutput: # DAX Optimization Analysis: [Sales USA (Slow)]\n\n## 1. Bottleneck Identification\nThe use of `FILTER(ALL(Customers), ...)` forces the engine to materialize the entire Customers table (1M rows) in memory for iteration, which is inefficient.\n\n## 2. Optimized DAX\n```dax\nSales USA (Optimized) := CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), KEEPFILTERS(Customers[Country] = \"USA\"))\n```\n\n## 3. Rationale\nBy replacing the iterator `FILTER(ALL(...))` with a direct filter on the column `Customers[Country]`, we allow the storage engine to leverage indexing and avoid materialization of the large dimension table. `KEEPFILTERS` ensures existing filters are respected.\n\n## 4. Validation Plan\n1. Run both measures in DAX Studio and compare results.\n2. Analyze the Server Timings (SE/FE) for the optimized measure.\n\nInput: context=Sales; measure_name=Total Sales\nOutput: DAX: Total Sales := SUM('Sales'[Amount])\nExplain row vs filter context and aggregation alternatives.",

FE: 4800ms. SE: 200ms. SE Queries: 1. Cache Hits: 0.\nModel Context: [Total Sales] involves complex iteration over a large fact table.\nOutput: **Analysis:** The metrics indicate a severe Formula Engine (FE) bottleneck. 96% of the time (4800ms) is spent in the FE, while the Storage Engine (SE) is fast (200ms). This typically occurs with complex iterators (SUMX, FILTER) or materialized intermediate tables that the FE must process row-by-row.\n\n**Recommendation:** The bottleneck is likely within the `[Total Sales]` measure definition. Refactor the measure to utilize `CALCULATE` and optimized functions that the SE can handle more efficiently. Review the DAX definition for excessive use of iterators and replace them with set-based operations.\n\nInput: dax_expression = \"Total Sales = SUMX(FILTER('Sales','Sales'[Status] = \\\"Closed\\\"), 'Sales'[Amount])\"\nOutput: -- Use CALCULATE instead of SUMX for better performance\nTotal Sales = CALCULATE(SUM('Sales'[Amount]), 'Sales'[Status] = \"Closed\")\n\nInput: dax_expression = \"YearToDate = CALCULATE(SUM('Sales'[Amount]), DATESBETWEEN('Date'[Date], MIN('Date'[Date]), MAX('Date'[Date])))\"\nOutput: -- Use DATESYTD for clarity and efficiency\nYearToDate = CALCULATE(SUM('Sales'[Amount]), DATESYTD('Date'[Date]))",

Utilization Analysis\n- **Overall Utilization:** The F64 capacity is underutilized on average (45%).\n- **Peak Usage:** A significant, predictable spike (95%) occurs between 4 AM - 6 AM, driven by the 'EnterpriseSalesReport' refresh.\n- **Throttling:** No throttling events suggest the current capacity meets the demand.\n\n## 2. Optimization Opportunities\n\n### Opportunity 1: Workload Optimization (Smoothing)\n- **Recommendation:** Optimize 'EnterpriseSalesReport' refresh (e.g., implement Incremental Refresh) or stagger other simultaneous refreshes to smooth the utilization curve.\n- **Cost/Benefit:** Potential to reduce peak demand, enabling downsizing. Low effort.\n\n### Opportunity 2: Capacity Downsizing (F64 to F32)\n- **Recommendation:** Consider downsizing to an F32 capacity *after* optimizing the peak workload.\n- **Cost/Benefit:** Potential savings of approx $4,000/month.\n- **Risk:** High risk of throttling if downsizing occurs *before* the peak utilization is reduced.\n\n## 3. Action Plan\n1. **Phase 1:** Optimize 'EnterpriseSalesReport' refresh.\n2. **Phase 2:** Monitor utilization to assess the reduction in peak CU usage.\n3. **Phase 3:** Pilot the F32 capacity and monitor for throttling.\n\nInput: context=Capacity hitting 100% during refresh\nOutput: Recommendations: stagger schedules, incremental partitions, memory settings.",

Analysis\nThe F64 capacity is experiencing overload (110%) and throttling (5%) between 4:00 AM and 5:00 AM UTC. This is caused by three major workloads running concurrently: SalesFactRefresh, CustomerDimRefresh, and DailyETLNotebook.\n\n## 2. Smoothing Strategy: Staggering and Optimization\nWe will stagger the execution times of these workloads to distribute the load while ensuring the 7:00 AM SLA is met.\n\n### Proposed Schedule:\n- **3:00 AM UTC:** Start `CustomerDimRefresh` (Typically faster as it's a dimension).\n- **3:30 AM UTC:** Start `DailyETLNotebook`.\n- **4:30 AM UTC (or upon completion of above):** Start `SalesFactRefresh`.\n\n### Optimization Opportunities:\n- **SalesFactRefresh (60% CU):** Investigate implementing Incremental Refresh. This is the largest consumer and offers the biggest potential reduction in CU usage.\n\n## 3. Expected Outcome\nBy staggering the workloads, the peak concurrent CU consumption should decrease significantly, eliminating the overload and throttling. If Incremental Refresh is implemented for SalesFactRefresh, the overall duration and CU consumption will further decrease.\n\n## 4. Monitoring\nMonitor the Fabric Capacity Metrics app closely after implementing the new schedule to verify the smoothing effect.",

Define New Parameters\nCreate the following Power Query parameters:\n- `prmServerName` (Text, Required)\n- `prmDatabaseName` (Text, Required)\n- `prmRegionFilter` (Text, Required)\n\n### 2. Refactored M Query\n```m\nlet\n    // Use parameters for connection details\n    Source = Sql.Database(prmServerName, prmDatabaseName),\n    Data = Source{[Schema=\"dbo\",Item=\"FactOrders\"]}[Data],\n    // Use parameter for the filter condition\n    #\"Filtered Rows\" = Table.SelectRows(Data, each [Region] = prmRegionFilter)\nin\n    #\"Filtered Rows\"\n```\n\n### 3. Rationale\nThis approach allows the query to be dynamically retargeted to different environments (Dev/Test/Prod) during deployment pipelines without editing the M code directly. All steps remain foldable as the parameters are used in foldable functions (Sql.Database and Table.SelectRows).",

High Severity (Performance): Bidirectional relationships active (DimCustomer <-> FactSales).\n2. Medium Severity (Performance): Use DIVIDE function for division (Measure: [Profit Margin]).\n3.

Change the 'Cross filter direction' from 'Both' to 'Single' (DimCustomer filters FactSales).\n    2. Review DAX measures. If needed, use `CROSSFILTER(..., Both)` sparingly within specific `CALCULATE` statements.\n\n### Priority 2: Medium Impact - Maintainability\n\n**2. Hide Foreign Keys**\n- **Issue:** Foreign keys exposed in the field list clutter the user interface.\n- **Remediation Steps:**\n    1. Set the `IsHidden` property to `True` for `FactSales[CustomerKey]`.\n\n### Priority 3: Medium Impact - DAX (Performance/Robustness)\n\n**3. Use DIVIDE function**\n- **Issue:** The measure `[Profit Margin]` likely uses the `/` operator, risking division by zero errors.\n- **Remediation Steps:**\n    1. Modify the DAX for `[Profit Margin]`.\n    2.

Folding Break Analysis\nThe step `#\"Added Index\"` breaks query folding. SQL Server cannot reliably fold `Table.AddIndexColumn`. All subsequent steps are processed locally by the Power Query engine, forcing a download of the entire source table.\n\n## 2. Optimized M Code\n```m\nlet\n    Source = Sql.Database(\"server.database.windows.net\", \"DB\"),\n    Sales_vSalesOrder = Source{[Schema=\"Sales\",Item=\"vSalesOrder\"]}[Data],\n    // Move foldable steps before the folding break\n    #\"Filtered Rows\" = Table.SelectRows(Sales_vSalesOrder, each [Status] = \"Shipped\"),\n    // Apply the non-foldable step last\n    #\"Added Index\" = Table.AddIndexColumn(#\"Filtered Rows\", \"Index\", 1, 1, Int64.Type)\nin\n    #\"Added Index\"\n```\n\n## 3. Rationale\nBy reordering the steps, we ensure that filtering (`Table.SelectRows`)—which folds to SQL—occurs before the non-foldable index addition. This significantly reduces the data volume downloaded.\n\nInput: m_query=let Source=... in ...\nOutput: M: Move filtering before joins to preserve folding; use Table.Buffer sparingly.",
