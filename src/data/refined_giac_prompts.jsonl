Smoothing Strategy: Staggering and Optimization\nWe will stagger the execution times of these workloads to distribute the load while ensuring the 7:00 AM SLA is met.\n\n### Proposed Schedule:\n- **3:00 AM UTC:** Start `CustomerDimRefresh` (Typically faster as it's a dimension).\n- **3:30 AM UTC:** Start `DailyETLNotebook`.\n- **4:30 AM UTC (or upon completion of above):** Start `SalesFactRefresh`.\n\n### Optimization Opportunities:\n- **SalesFactRefresh (60% CU):** Investigate implementing Incremental Refresh.
