Here are 20 additional navigation‑focused improvements that build on the initial recommendations (synonyms, scope clarity and descriptive labels). Each improvement includes a short problem description, a proposed change, expected impact and effort estimate, and evidence gathered from the current FabricAgent Prompt Explorer.

1. **Surface search suggestions and auto‑complete**
   *Problem:* The search bar returns no results without offering guidance (e.g., typing “resume” shows *No prompts found*).
   *Recommendation:* Add dynamic suggestions under the search bar (common queries, matching tags, and recently searched terms) and implement auto‑complete with synonyms to help users reformulate queries.
   *Impact:* High | *Effort:* Medium | *Evidence:* Empty search results screen.

2. **Expand the synonym library to include career terms**
   *Problem:* Users looking for resume or cover‑letter prompts still get zero results.
   *Recommendation:* Enrich the synonym mapping with terms like “resume,” “CV,” “cover letter,” and “job application” so they map to relevant prompts or categories (e.g., skills evaluation or portfolio prompts).
   *Impact:* High | *Effort:* Medium | *Evidence:* Search for “resume” shows no matches.

3. **Introduce a ‘Career & Soft‑Skills’ category**
   *Problem:* The catalog only lists technical pillars (e.g., AI Safety, Dax, Compliance), so users cannot browse or filter prompts related to resumes, interviews or personal branding.
   *Recommendation:* Create a dedicated “Career & Soft‑Skills” section with prompts for crafting resumes, cover letters and portfolio apps like FabricAgent, and include it in the pillar filter area.
   *Impact:* High | *Effort:* Medium | *Evidence:* Pillar filters are currently all technical.

4. **Add sort and filter options for results**
   *Problem:* Results lists show many prompts but cannot be sorted by relevance, date, popularity or source.
   *Recommendation:* Provide sorting (by newest, most viewed, highest‑rated) and additional filters (source, date range, tag counts) to help users quickly locate relevant prompts.
   *Impact:* Medium | *Effort:* Small | *Evidence:* Single, unsorted list of prompts in the catalog.

5. **Show related prompts within the prompt detail modal**
   *Problem:* The detail modal only shows summary and embedded video; there is no pathway to discover similar prompts.
   *Recommendation:* Add a “Related prompts” section with up to five suggestions based on shared tags, categories or sources.
   *Impact:* Medium | *Effort:* Medium | *Evidence:* Current modal lacks related links.

6. **Enable bookmark or favorite functionality**
   *Problem:* Users cannot save or revisit interesting prompts later.
   *Recommendation:* Allow logged‑in users to mark prompts as favorites and view them in a personal dashboard; optionally share favorites via a unique URL.
   *Impact:* Medium | *Effort:* Medium | *Evidence:* No “save” or “favorite” option appears in the UI.

7. **Enhance prompt summaries and examples**
   *Problem:* Summaries are brief and generic (e.g., “Expert guidance on dax, power query…”), with no input/output examples or usage tips.
   *Recommendation:* Expand each prompt description to include a problem statement, sample inputs, expected outputs, and best‑practice tips; highlight how the prompt can help craft resumes or build an app like FabricAgent when relevant.
   *Impact:* Medium | *Effort:* Medium | *Evidence:* Short summary in modal.

8. **Improve zero‑results feedback**
   *Problem:* When no prompts match a query, the catalog simply states “No prompts found” without suggestions.
   *Recommendation:* Provide helpful suggestions (e.g., “Try ‘Power BI’ or explore categories below”), show top categories, and invite feedback if a term is missing.
   *Impact:* High | *Effort:* Small | *Evidence:* Empty state for “resume” search.

9. **Clarify pillar and tag meanings**
   *Problem:* Pillars like “Semantic Model” or “Dax” may be unfamiliar to newcomers.
   *Recommendation:* Add tooltips or info icons explaining each pillar/tag and how they relate to user goals (e.g., “Dax: prompts about DAX formulas for Power BI”).
   *Impact:* Medium | *Effort:* Small | *Evidence:* Pillars displayed without definitions.

10. **Explain ‘Any (OR)’ vs ‘All (AND)’ filter**
    *Problem:* The Pillars match options “Any (OR)” and “All (AND)” appear without explanation, potentially confusing less technical users.
    *Recommendation:* Provide brief explanatory text or a tooltip clarifying that “Any” shows prompts matching any selected pillar, while “All” restricts results to prompts matching every pillar.
    *Impact:* Low | *Effort:* Small | *Evidence:* Filter labels are terse.

11. **Ensure robust keyboard and assistive‑technology support**
    *Problem:* Current navigation depends heavily on mouse interaction; modals may not trap focus.
    *Recommendation:* Implement proper ARIA roles, keyboard focus states, and skip links; ensure modals can be opened and closed via keyboard and that focus doesn’t escape to the page behind.
    *Impact:* Medium | *Effort:* Medium | *Evidence:* Modal lacks visible keyboard cues.

12. **Improve mobile responsiveness and scaling**
    *Problem:* The interface is dense with filters and chips; on small screens these may wrap poorly or become unusable.
    *Recommendation:* Test on common phone sizes and optimize layout (collapsible filter drawer, responsive chip stacking) to maintain usability on mobile.
    *Impact:* Medium | *Effort:* Medium | *Evidence:* Desktop‑only layout suggests possible mobile issues.

13. **Add a brief onboarding / about section**
    *Problem:* New visitors may not understand the site’s purpose, especially the difference between catalogue and workforce, or why “Guy in a Cube” matters.
    *Recommendation:* Include a “Get started” tooltip or introduction video explaining the mission (e.g., “discover AI prompts for Power BI & Fabric projects”) and how to build portfolios like FabricAgent using curated prompts.
    *Impact:* Medium | *Effort:* Small | *Evidence:* No onboarding guidance is visible on landing page.

14. **Display popularity or usage metrics**
    *Problem:* All prompts appear equal; users cannot gauge which are widely used or recommended.
    *Recommendation:* Show simple metrics (e.g., number of times used, upvotes) on prompt cards and allow sorting by popularity; highlight trending prompts in a sidebar.
    *Impact:* Medium | *Effort:* Medium | *Evidence:* Card list lacks popularity indicators.

15. **Make sharing easy**
    *Problem:* Users may want to share interesting prompts with colleagues or include them in a resume submission, but there is no obvious share button.
    *Recommendation:* Add a “Copy link” or “Share prompt” button within each prompt modal to copy a direct URL or embed code.
    *Impact:* Low | *Effort:* Small | *Evidence:* Modal lacks share controls.

16. **Highlight search terms in results**
    *Problem:* Search result lists do not highlight the matching keywords, making it harder to see relevance.
    *Recommendation:* Bold or color‑highlight matching terms within titles and summaries so users can quickly verify relevance.
    *Impact:* Low | *Effort:* Small | *Evidence:* Current results show plain text.

17. **Enable multi‑select and combination filters**
    *Problem:* Users cannot mix multiple tags or pillars easily; there is no multi‑select for categories beyond pillars and source.
    *Recommendation:* Allow multi‑selection of tags (e.g., “Dax” + “Semantic Model”) and combine filters from different pillars, with an intuitive UI to remove them individually.
    *Impact:* Medium | *Effort:* Medium | *Evidence:* Pillars section is limited to single‑selection chips.

18. **Support advanced search syntax**
    *Problem:* The search bar handles only simple keyword searches.
    *Recommendation:* Add support for Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), quoted phrases, and wildcards; provide examples in a tooltip.
    *Impact:* Medium | *Effort:* Medium | *Evidence:* Search uses simple text input with no advanced options.

19. **Label new and recently updated prompts**
    *Problem:* Users cannot tell which prompts are new or have been revised.
    *Recommendation:* Add a “New” or “Updated” badge on prompt cards (based on date metadata) and a filter to show items added in the last 30/60 days.
    *Impact:* Low | *Effort:* Small | *Evidence:* No temporal cues are present.

20. **Collect user feedback on prompts**
    *Problem:* There is no channel for users to report issues or suggest improvements to prompts.
    *Recommendation:* Include a feedback or rating widget on each prompt modal to collect comments or star ratings; aggregate feedback to inform future revisions.
    *Impact:* Medium | *Effort:* Medium | *Evidence:* Modals lack feedback controls.

These improvements would make FabricAgent Prompt Explorer more intuitive for users like Paul who are trying to build an aligned app and tailor their resume, by improving search discoverability, adding relevant categories, enhancing navigation, and making the site more accessible and informative.
